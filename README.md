## Configuration

All you need to run this app on your server.

When you have cloned this app, you have to run a `composer install` 
> Take a coffee 

Then you have to run `yarn install`
> Take a second coffee

This two past command will download all the packages 
you need to run the app on your server. There are all available in `composer.json` and in `yarn.lock`.

Then you have to configure your `.env` :


### **If you want to make some changes in dev environment :** 

1. You have to create a `.env.local`. 
    > DATABASE_URL=mysql://_youruser_:_yourpassword_@127.0.0.1:3306/alsaceNature

    Change _youruser_ and by _yourpassword_ with your mysql credentials
    Please double check your port and your localServer address for the BDD.
    
1. Configure mailer:
    
    We develop this application with Gmail and mailer, feel free to change anything
    you want if you prefer another mailer.
    
    >MAILER_DSN=gmail://_yourmail_:_yourpassword_@default
    
    Change _yourmail_ and _yourpassword_ with your gmail credentials
     (don't forget to configure your [google account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=fr#:~:text=acc%C3%A9dez%20%C3%A0%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9-,Applications%20moins%20s%C3%A9curis%C3%A9es.,au%20bas%20de%20la%20page.&text=Ensuite%2C%20dans%20la%20section%20Applications,relatifs%20aux%20applications%20moins%20s%C3%A9curis%C3%A9es.
    "How to configure your google account")).

1. Run `yarn encore dev` to compile all scss file 
and create all builds needed.


### **If you want to deploy on your server :**

If you use your own script for deployment please go on next topic.<br>
Else: 

1. Clone master on your server.

2. Same as dev environment [â†‘](#if-you-want-to-make-some-changes-in-dev-environment-) but you have to configure `.env` instead (Gmail is depreciated in prod environment).

3. Run `composer install` `yarn install`  and then run `yarn encore prod`.

4. Run `APP_ENV=prod APP_DEBUG=0 php bin/console cache:clear`
To convert the app from dev in prod.

5. Run `yarn encore prod`.

---

#### In both case:  

1. Create your database, run `php bin/console doctrine:database:create`.

2. Run `php bin/console d:s:u --force`.

Run your app with ``symfony server:start``

Shut down your app with ``symfony server:stop``

## Hierarchy

There is 6 level of hierarchy on this app:
- Level 1 : **Anonymous** :  user who is not connected and just navigate in the front pages.
- Level 2 : **User** (ROLE_USER) : a user who has account but no permission and can just navigate in front page and can participate to event and add some favorite events.
- Level 3 : **Intevenant** (ROLE_EVENT) : a user who can create events for a specific structure (granted by admin structure or admin territory if the structure is in his territory or superAdmin)

- Level 5 : **Admin Territory** (ROLE_TERRITORY) : admin of a territory (department) can manage structure of his territory (granted by superAdmin)
- Level 6 : **superAdmin** (ROLE_ADMIN) : superAdmin of the app.
